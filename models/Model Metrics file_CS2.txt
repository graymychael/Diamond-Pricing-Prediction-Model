________________
Model Performance
* R², RMSE, Confusion Matrix, Precision & Recall, AUC/ROC
Model Findings
* Feature Importances include Price which was the best target feature for the data
Next Steps
* The Lasso Regression Model showed the best performance with a balanced complexity for the data
* New hyperparameters were tested and different modeling methods chosen
